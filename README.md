## ‚ö†Ô∏è WhatsApp Cloud API Limitations

Due to restrictions imposed by the WhatsApp Cloud API, there are important usage limitations:

### 1. ‚úÖ Pre-approved Template Must Be Sent First

-  **Requirement:** You must send a pre-approved template message (e.g., `hello_world`) to a contact **before** sending any regular text message.
-  **Why?** This ensures the recipient has opted-in or is recognized by WhatsApp as having accepted messages from your business.
-  **Solution:** A **"Verify"** button is shown in the app next to unverified contacts. When clicked, it sends the required template message.

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Contacts Must Be Added to WhatsApp Business Manager

-  Any recipient phone number must be manually added and approved in the **WhatsApp Business Manager** under **Test Numbers**.
-  Without this step, you will receive a `403` error or `recipient not allowed` error even if the number is real.
